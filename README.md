## INTERGRATE AND MONITOR SECURITY WITH APPLICATION, DOCKER KUBERNETES USING DevSecOps APPROACH






DevOps has made it possible to develop applications in a fast quicker time by time by aligning development, test, and production tea, however, in most cases, security is not integrated into the development process and the test becomes vulnerable to risks of bugs. Here is where DevSecOps comes into the picture. The DevSecOps approach includes incorporating security as a significant component of DevOps practices. Whiles DevOps refers to the collaboration of developments, and testing of the operation team to achieve continuous delivery, DevSecOps involves the integration of security with the sane DevOps process. DevOps includes several areas of focus which include Automated provisioning, continuous Monitoring, continuous integration, and test-driven developments. As an extension of DevOps Mindset, DevSecOps is the methodology of integrating security tools into the DevOps process. In this Project, an EasyBuggie Vulnerability web Application was developed using Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS
