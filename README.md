## INTEGRATING AND MONITORING SECURITY WITHIN APPLICATIONS, DOCKER, AND KUBERNETES USING DevSecOps APPROACH



This project aims to demonstrate the integration and monitoring of security practices within applications, Docker, and Kubernetes environments using the DevSecOps approach. By adopting this methodology, we can ensure robust security measures throughout the software development and deployment lifecycle (SDLC).


# Introduction
In today's digital landscape, security is a top concern for organizations. The integration and monitoring of security within applications, Docker, and Kubernetes environments play a vital role in ensuring the protection and integrity of software systems. This project focuses on leveraging the DevSecOps approach to seamlessly integrate security practices and monitor security throughout the entire software development and deployment process.

# Key Features
  1. Secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities within applications.
  2. Threat modeling exercises to identify potential risks and implement proactive security controls.
  3. Security testing, including static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and penetration testing.
  4. Secure container image creation and management in Docker.
  5. Implementing container security policies within Kubernetes clusters.
  6. Secure management of sensitive information using Kubernetes secrets.
  7. Logging and monitoring solutions for detecting and responding to security events.
  8. Incident response planning and automation for efficient security incident handling.
  9. Continuous compliance checks to ensure adherence to security best practices and compliance standards.
