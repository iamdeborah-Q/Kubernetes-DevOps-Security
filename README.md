## INTEGRATING AND MONITORING SECURITY WITHIN APPLICATIONS, DOCKER, AND KUBERNETES USING DevSecOps APPROACH



This project aims to demonstrate the integration and monitoring of security practices within applications, Docker, and Kubernetes environments using the DevSecOps approach. By adopting this methodology, we can ensure robust security measures throughout the software development and deployment lifecycle (SDLC).
